    "**Have you ever wondered how websites like Bukalapak are so good at suggesting products you might want, even before you start searching for them?**\n",

    "Well, the answer to this marvel lies in something called \"Recommendation Systems.\" These systems are like your shopping companions in the digital world, and they're pretty good at understanding your preferences and showing you things you'd love.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break it down a bit. Recommendation systems are like helpful friends who pay attention to what you look at, what you buy, and even what you put in your virtual shopping cart. They do this to get a sense of what you like. Then, using some clever math and algorithms, they suggest other products that you might find interesting. That's why you often see suggestions like \"People Also Bought\" or \"You Might Also Like.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do these systems know what you'll like? That's what we'll explore **Collaborative filtering** is one of basic models for recommendation system which are based on assumption that people like things similar to other things they like, or things that are liked by other people which have similar taste with them.\n",

    "In <b>collaborative filtering</b> method there are two approaches which can be implemented :<br>\n",
    "<b>1. Memory-based approach: </b>create recommendation system by calculated closest users or items using cosine similarity or pearson correlation coefficients.<br>\n",
